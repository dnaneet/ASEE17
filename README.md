# ASEE17
This repository holds MATLAB code and code snippets described in the ASEE 2017 paper.  The code in this repository requires MATLAB's partial differential equations toolbox (pdetool).  Instructors may download this material and use for their courses.  Please cite this work appropriately (Narendranath, A.D., 2017. *"Introducing the Galerkin method of weighted residuals into an undergraduate elective course in finite element methods"*, ASEE Conference 2017).  Files deposited here would need MATLAB and its partial differential equations toolbox (pdetool).

**poiseuille_flow.m**

**oneD_heat_source_steady.m**
One dimensional, heat conduction problem with a volumetric heat source term. 

**interpolation.m**
Code snippet that allows for interpolating solution data on FEM mesh/grid.
